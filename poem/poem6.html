<h2>Advice To A Son ~ Ernest Hemingway</h2>
  <p>
    Never trust a white man,<br>
    Never kill a Jew,<br>
    Never sign a contract,<br>
    Never rent a pew.<br>
    Don't enlist in armies;<br>
    Nor marry many wives;<br>
    Never write for magazines;<br>
    Never scratch your hives.<br>
    Always put paper on the seat,<br>
    Don't believe in wars,<br>
    Keep yourself both clean and neat,<br>
    Never marry whores.<br>
    Never pay a blackmailer,<br>
    Never go to law,<br>
    Never trust a publisher,<br>
    Or you'll sleep on straw.<br>
    All your friends will leave you<br>
    All your friends will die<br>
    So lead a clean and wholesome life<br>
    And join them in the sky.</p>
