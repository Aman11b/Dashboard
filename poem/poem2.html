  <h2>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night ~ Dylan Thomas </h2>
  
</section>
<p>
	Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
	Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
	Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>
	Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
	Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
	Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>
	Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
	Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
	Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>
	Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
	And learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,<br>
	Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>
	Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
	Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
	Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>
	And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
	Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
	Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
	Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
